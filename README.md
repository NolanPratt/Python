This repository will act as my Python development portfolio environment. All posted programs are written and tested by me alone as of now. In the case that some of these are to be used, asking for use is not needed, but I would like to know about the applications where my code would be useful.

If you have any insight on more efficient paractices or spot any errors or flaws than can arise when attempting to scale the programs, feel free to let me know. I am happy to collaborate on any programs within this repository and otherwise.
